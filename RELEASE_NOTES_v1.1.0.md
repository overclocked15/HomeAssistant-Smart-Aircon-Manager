# Smart Aircon Manager v1.1.0 - Production Stability Release

## Overview

Version 1.1.0 focuses on production reliability and stability improvements. This release adds comprehensive input validation, robust error handling, and fan speed smoothing to ensure the integration runs smoothly in all conditions.

## What's New

### üõ°Ô∏è Input Validation
- **Configuration Parameter Validation**: All configuration values are now validated on startup
  - Target temperature validated to 10-35¬∞C range
  - All numeric thresholds validated and clamped to safe ranges
  - Invalid configuration logged with clear warnings
- **Sensor Data Validation**: Temperature readings validated with sanity checks
  - Realistic temperature range: -50¬∞C to 70¬∞C
  - Malformed sensor data safely ignored instead of crashing
  - Zero/near-zero readings flagged as suspicious
- **Cover Position Validation**: Cover positions validated and clamped to 0-100%
- **Benefits**: Prevents integration crashes from bad sensor data or misconfiguration

### üîß Error Handling
- **Comprehensive Exception Handling**: Main optimization loop wrapped with try-catch
  - All exceptions logged with full stack traces
  - Safe fallback state returned on errors
  - Error count tracking for monitoring
- **Detailed Logging**: Better error messages for troubleshooting
  - Uses `exc_info=True` for complete error context
  - Separate error tracking for different failure types
- **Benefits**: Integration stays running even when unexpected errors occur

### üåä Fan Speed Smoothing
- **Prevents Oscillation**: Smooths fan speed transitions near temperature band boundaries
  - Weighted average algorithm (70% new, 30% previous speed)
  - Only applies to small changes (‚â§10% speed difference)
  - Large changes applied immediately for responsiveness
- **Per-Room Tracking**: Each room's fan speed history tracked independently
- **Debug Logging**: Shows when smoothing is applied for transparency
- **Benefits**:
  - Eliminates rapid fan speed changes that cause noise
  - Reduces mechanical wear on fan motors
  - Smoother, more comfortable user experience

## Technical Details

### Code Changes
- Added 3 new validation methods to optimizer.py:
  - `_validate_temperature()` - Temperature range validation
  - `_validate_positive_float()` - Numeric parameter validation
  - `_validate_sensor_temperature()` - Sensor reading validation
- Added `_smooth_fan_speed()` method for fan speed dampening
- Refactored `async_optimize()` with error handling wrapper
- Enhanced `_collect_room_states()` with validation
- **Total**: ~90 lines of new validation and error handling code

### Breaking Changes
None - This is a fully backward-compatible release

### Migration
No migration needed - simply upgrade to v1.1.0

## Installation

### Via HACS (Recommended)
1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
2. Go to Integrations
3. Find "Smart Aircon Manager"
4. Click "Update" to install v1.1.0

### Manual Installation
1. Download `smart_aircon_manager.zip` from the release
2. Extract to `custom_components/smart_aircon_manager/`
3. Restart Home Assistant

## Upgrading from v1.0.0

1. **Backup**: Always backup your configuration before upgrading
2. **Update**: Install v1.1.0 via HACS or manually
3. **Restart**: Restart Home Assistant
4. **Verify**: Check logs for any validation warnings about your configuration

If you see validation warnings in the logs, review your configuration - the integration will continue running with safe defaults.

## Known Issues

None

## Performance Impact

- Negligible performance impact from validation (~1ms per optimization cycle)
- Fan speed smoothing adds <1ms processing time per room
- Overall: No noticeable performance difference

## What's Next

Future releases will focus on:
- Performance metrics sensors (optimization cycle time, error rates)
- Configuration validation UI
- Unit tests for validation logic
- Additional smoothing algorithms

## Support

- **Issues**: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/overclocked15/HomeAssistant-Smart-Aircon-Manager/issues)
- **Documentation**: [README.md](https://github.com/overclocked15/HomeAssistant-Smart-Aircon-Manager/blob/main/README.md)

## Credits

This is a logic-based alternative to AI-powered HVAC control. It provides:
- 100% local operation (no external API calls)
- Zero cost (no AI API fees)
- Fast response times (10s polling, 30s optimization)
- Predictable, transparent behavior
