## 🎯 Temperature Control Algorithm

### Heating/Cooling Control (8 Bands)
```
Deviation from Target  →  Fan Speed  →  Action
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
4.0°C+                 →  100%       →  Extreme
3.0-4.0°C             →   90%       →  Very high
2.0-3.0°C             →   75%       →  High
1.5-2.0°C             →   65%       →  Moderately high
1.0-1.5°C             →   55%       →  Moderate
0.7-1.0°C             →   45%       →  Gentle
0.5-0.7°C             →   40%       →  Minimal
Within ±0.5°C         →   50%       →  Maintain
```

### Overshoot Handling (5 Bands)
```
Overshoot Amount  →  Fan Speed  →  Action
───────────────────────────────────────────
3.0°C+            →   5%        →  Near shutdown
2.0-3.0°C         →  12%        →  Minimal airflow
1.0-2.0°C         →  22%        →  Reduced
0.7-1.0°C         →  30%        →  Gentle
0.5-0.7°C         →  35%        →  Slight
```
