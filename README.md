# Smart Aircon Manager

A Home Assistant integration that uses **intelligent logic-based algorithms** to automatically manage your air conditioning system by adjusting zone fan speeds based on temperature sensors in each room. **No AI API required** - completely free and runs 100% locally!

> **This is the free, logic-based alternative** to the AI-powered version. It uses smart algorithms and rules to achieve similar results without requiring expensive AI API subscriptions.

## Features

### Core Capabilities
- **Logic-Based Management**: Smart algorithms intelligently manage zone fan speeds
- **100% Local**: No external API calls, completely private and free
- **Multi-Room Support**: Configure multiple rooms with individual temperature sensors and zone controls
- **Temperature Equalization**: Automatically balances temperatures across all rooms
- **Smart Redistribution**: Increases fan speed in hot rooms, reduces in cold rooms to equalize
- **Main Aircon Fan Control**: Automatically adjusts your main AC unit's fan speed (low/medium/high) based on system needs
- **Automatic AC On/Off Control**: Can automatically turn your main AC on/off based on need with hysteresis
- **Automatic AC Temperature Control**: Can automatically control your main AC's temperature setpoint for fully hands-off operation
- **Comprehensive Diagnostics**: Detailed sensors for monitoring and troubleshooting
- **Climate Entity**: Provides a climate entity to view overall system status and set target temperature
- **Flexible Configuration**: Easy UI-based setup through Home Assistant config flow with options to reconfigure

### Advanced Features
- **Room Overrides**: Disable control for specific rooms while keeping others active
- **Heating/Cooling Modes**: Support for both heating and cooling with mode-aware optimizations
- **HVAC Mode Auto-Detection**: Can automatically detect heating/cooling from main climate entity
- **Hysteresis Control**: Prevents rapid AC on/off cycling with configurable thresholds
- **Startup Delay**: Grace period during Home Assistant startup to prevent false alarms
- **Persistent Notifications**: Optional notifications for important events (AC control, errors)

### Smart Automation Features
- **Weather Integration**: Automatically adjusts target temperature based on outdoor conditions
  - Hot weather (>30°C): Sets AC slightly cooler to combat heat
  - Cold weather (<15°C): Sets AC slightly warmer to prevent overcooling
  - Supports weather entities and outdoor temperature sensors
- **Time-Based Scheduling**: Different target temperatures for different times and days
  - Multiple schedules with individual target temperatures
  - Day-of-week scheduling (weekdays, weekends, specific days, or all days)
  - Time range support including cross-midnight schedules (e.g., 22:00-08:00)
  - Schedule priority over base target temperature
- **Progressive Overshoot Handling**: Gradual fan reduction for rooms that overshoot target while maintaining air circulation
  - Small overshoot (<1°C): Reduced to 25-35% for gentle correction
  - Medium overshoot (1-2°C): Reduced to 15-25% for moderate correction
  - High overshoot (2-3°C): Reduced to 5-15% for minimal airflow
  - Severe overshoot (3°C+): Shutdown to 0-5% only in extreme cases
- **Improved Main Fan Logic**: Smarter thresholds for low/medium/high fan speeds

## How It Works

1. The integration monitors temperature sensors in each configured room
2. **Fast polling**: Reads sensor data every **10 seconds** for responsive monitoring
3. **Frequent optimization**: Adjusts fan speeds every **30 seconds** for precise control
4. **Granular logic-based algorithm** calculates optimal fan speeds with 8 temperature bands:
   - **4°C+ above target**: 100% fan speed (extreme heat/cold)
   - **3-4°C above**: 90% fan speed (very hot/cold)
   - **2-3°C above**: 75% fan speed (hot/cold)
   - **1.5-2°C above**: 65% fan speed (moderately hot/cold)
   - **1-1.5°C above**: 55% fan speed (slightly hot/cold)
   - **0.7-1°C above**: 45% fan speed (just above target)
   - **0.5-0.7°C above**: 40% fan speed (barely above target)
   - **Within 0.5°C**: 50% fan speed (at target - maintain circulation)
5. **Progressive overshoot handling** for rooms that are too cold/warm
6. **Optional**: Can also set optimal AC temperature setpoint based on room conditions
7. This creates smooth, responsive temperature equilibrium across your entire house
8. The fast update cycle (30s) ensures rooms quickly reach and maintain target temperature

### Why Logic-Based Instead of AI?

The logic-based approach offers several advantages:

- **Zero Cost**: No monthly API fees (AI version costs $1-4/month)
- **100% Private**: No data sent to external services
- **Predictable**: Deterministic behavior you can understand and trust
- **Fast**: Instant decisions without API latency
- **Reliable**: No dependency on external services
- **Transparent**: You can see exactly how decisions are made

The logic algorithms are based on proven HVAC control strategies and have been carefully tuned to provide excellent temperature management.

### Cooling Mode Strategy

**For rooms ABOVE target** (need cooling) - 8 granular bands:
- **4°C+ above**: 100% fan (extreme heat - maximum cooling)
- **3-4°C above**: 90% fan (very hot - aggressive cooling)
- **2-3°C above**: 75% fan (hot - strong cooling)
- **1.5-2°C above**: 65% fan (moderately hot - good cooling)
- **1-1.5°C above**: 55% fan (slightly hot - moderate cooling)
- **0.7-1°C above**: 45% fan (just above - gentle cooling)
- **0.5-0.7°C above**: 40% fan (barely above - minimal cooling)

**For rooms BELOW target** (overshot, too cold) - 5 progressive bands:
- **3°C+ below**: 5% fan (severe overshoot - near shutdown)
- **2-3°C below**: 12% fan (high overshoot - minimal airflow)
- **1-2°C below**: 22% fan (medium overshoot - reduced cooling)
- **0.7-1°C below**: 30% fan (small overshoot - gentle reduction)
- **0.5-0.7°C below**: 35% fan (very small overshoot - slight reduction)

**For rooms AT TARGET** (within ±0.5°C deadband):
- **50% fan** (baseline circulation - maintains comfort)

### Heating Mode Strategy

**For rooms BELOW target** (need heating) - 8 granular bands:
- **4°C+ below**: 100% fan (extreme cold - maximum heating)
- **3-4°C below**: 90% fan (very cold - aggressive heating)
- **2-3°C below**: 75% fan (cold - strong heating)
- **1.5-2°C below**: 65% fan (moderately cold - good heating)
- **1-1.5°C below**: 55% fan (slightly cold - moderate heating)
- **0.7-1°C below**: 45% fan (just below - gentle heating)
- **0.5-0.7°C below**: 40% fan (barely below - minimal heating)

**For rooms ABOVE target** (overshot, too warm) - 5 progressive bands:
- **3°C+ above**: 5% fan (severe overshoot - near shutdown)
- **2-3°C above**: 12% fan (high overshoot - minimal airflow)
- **1-2°C above**: 22% fan (medium overshoot - reduced heating)
- **0.7-1°C above**: 30% fan (small overshoot - gentle reduction)

**For rooms AT TARGET** (within ±0.5°C deadband):
- **50% fan** (baseline circulation - maintains comfort)

### Main Fan Control Logic

The main AC fan speed is automatically adjusted:

- **Low Fan Speed**: All rooms at or near target (≤1°C variance, ≤0.5°C average deviation)
- **High Fan Speed**: Significant heating/cooling needed (≥2.5°C average deviation OR ≥3°C max deviation)
- **Medium Fan Speed**: All other conditions

### AC Temperature Control Logic

When automatic AC temperature control is enabled:

**Cooling Mode:**
- Aggressive cooling (rooms 2°C+ too hot): Sets AC to 19°C
- Moderate cooling (rooms 0.5-2°C too hot): Sets AC to 21°C
- Maintenance (rooms near target): Sets AC to 23°C

**Heating Mode:**
- Aggressive heating (rooms 2°C+ too cold): Sets AC to 25°C
- Moderate heating (rooms 0.5-2°C too cold): Sets AC to 23°C
- Maintenance (rooms near target): Sets AC to 21°C
