## v2.16.2 - Per-Room Target Fixes

**Release Date**: 2026-05-16

Two coupled bugs around per-room target overrides, surfaced by a user whose 21°C global target was overshooting to 22–23°C while one room (Medical Supplies) had a 25°C override.

### High Severity Fixes
- **AC unit-level decisions averaged per-room targets instead of using the global target**: `_check_if_ac_needed`, `_calculate_ac_temperature`, and the rest of the unit-level pipeline asked `_get_house_effective_target` for a reference, which returns the *weighted average* of per-room targets. Result: a single 25°C override on one room pulled the effective target up to ~21.7°C, so the AC kept heating past the user's 21°C global target — overheating every other room. The fix introduces `_current_global_effective_target` (schedule + weather, **no** per-room weighting), set once per cycle in `_async_optimize_impl` ([optimizer.py:1513](../custom_components/smart_aircon_manager/optimizer.py#L1513)) and consumed by `_check_if_ac_needed` ([optimizer.py:2929](../custom_components/smart_aircon_manager/optimizer.py#L2929)) and `_calculate_ac_temperature` ([optimizer.py:2287](../custom_components/smart_aircon_manager/optimizer.py#L2287)). Per-room targets still drive per-room damper logic in `_calculate_fan_speed`, so they affect *individual* room conditioning but no longer hijack the central AC's reference. This gives per-room overrides "best-effort" semantics: a 25°C room override won't prevent the rest of the house from reaching the 21°C target.
- **Per-room target override couldn't be removed from the UI**: `async_step_edit_room` rendered the optional fields with `vol.Optional(..., default=room_target)`. Voluptuous's `default=` substitutes the value back when the form is submitted empty, so clearing the field in the UI silently re-saved the original override. Switched both `CONF_HUMIDITY_SENSOR` and `CONF_ROOM_TARGET_TEMPERATURE` to `vol.Optional(..., description={"suggested_value": ...})`, which pre-fills the field for editing without forcing a substitution on empty submit. Clearing the field in the UI now actually removes the override.

### Tests
- Added `TestPerRoomTargetMath` (3 cases): AC turns off once the house exceeds the global target even with a higher per-room override; AC stays on while any room is below the global target; setpoint stays at the global target with a per-room override present.
- Suite is now 119 tests, all passing.

### Behavioral Note
If you genuinely want one room to *reach* a higher target than the rest of the house, a single central AC can't satisfy that without overheating other rooms — there's no clean answer with one supply temperature. v2.16.2 chooses "don't overheat the house" as the default. If you want a room consistently warmer, consider a supplementary heat source for that room rather than a per-room target override.

## v2.16.1 - Production-Stability Audit Fixes

**Release Date**: 2026-05-16

In-depth review across every file in the integration (optimizer, climate, sensor, learning, critical_monitor, config_flow, persistence, services) looking for production-grade reliability issues. Six fixes shipped, ordered by impact.

### High Severity Fix
- **Overnight schedules couldn't be created via the UI**: `async_step_add_schedule` ([config_flow.py:939](../custom_components/smart_aircon_manager/config_flow.py#L939)) rejected `start_time >= end_time` with `schedule_start_after_end`, blocking any schedule that wraps midnight (e.g. `22:00 → 06:00`). The optimizer's `_get_active_schedule` was extended in v2.16.0 to handle the overnight case, but the UI validator wasn't updated to match. Now allows `start > end` and only blocks `start == end` (an instantaneous schedule is useless either way).

### Medium Severity Fixes
- **Non-atomic state-file writes**: `_save_compressor_state`, `async_save_profiles`, and `async_save_data_points` all wrote directly to the destination file. A Home Assistant crash mid-write would leave a half-written JSON document, and the next startup's `_load_*` would throw a `json.JSONDecodeError` and reset everything. All three now write to a `.tmp` sibling and atomically `replace()` the destination — the previous valid file stays intact on crash.
- **HVAC mode tracker seeded with non-conditioning states on startup**: `async_setup` ([optimizer.py:368](../custom_components/smart_aircon_manager/optimizer.py#L368)) accepted any climate-entity state other than `"unavailable"` as `_last_hvac_mode`, so booting with the AC off persisted `_last_hvac_mode = "off"` until the next mode determination. Mode-dependent branches in adaptive efficiency, adaptive AC setpoint, and convergence adjustment all branch on `cool`/`heat`/`dry`/`fan_only`, so a leaked `"off"` left them in fall-through states longer than necessary. Now only seeds with real conditioning modes.
- **Climate `set_temperature` accepted out-of-range values**: the UI's NumberSelector enforces 10°C–35°C, but `climate.set_temperature` service calls bypass it. The entity now declares `_attr_min_temp`/`_attr_max_temp` and `async_set_temperature` rejects values outside that range with a warning rather than silently propagating them to the optimizer.

### Low Severity Fixes
- **`ACTemperatureRecommendationSensor` attribute used wrong target source**: the `target_temperature` attribute read only the first room's target with a stale comment claiming "they all use the same target", which hasn't been true since per-room target overrides were added. Now averages across all rooms to match `_get_house_effective_target`. Also tightened `if avg_temp` checks to `is not None` so a literal 0°C reading (rare but valid) isn't treated as missing data.
- **`async_cleanup` didn't persist compressor state**: on integration unload/reload, the in-memory `_ac_last_turned_on`/`_ac_last_turned_off` timestamps and any active quick-action expiry were lost. Cleanup now saves compressor state before saving learning profiles, so a reload preserves the min on/off timers.

### Reviewed and Clean
Audited (no issues found): service registration in `__init__.py`, climate entity hvac-mode persistence, binary sensor states, manual override switch persistence, learning math (overshoot frequency, thermal mass, cooling efficiency, correlation), critical room status machine, temperature normalization (F/C), diagnostics redaction, room/schedule duplicate name validation, optimizer's retry logic with exponential backoff.

### Tests
- Added `TestHvacModeInitialization` (2 cases): `"off"` state at startup must not seed `_last_hvac_mode`; a real conditioning mode (`"cool"`) at startup should seed it. Suite is now 116 tests, all passing.

## v2.16.0 - Adaptive Deadband + Three Latent Bug Fixes

**Release Date**: 2026-05-16

### New: Adaptive Deadband
Opt-in feature that widens the temperature deadband when the house is mid-swing and tightens it when stable, reducing mode-thrashing between active conditioning and fan-only/dry without sacrificing steady-state precision. Configured via the **Advanced** settings step:

- `enable_adaptive_deadband` (default `False`)
- `adaptive_deadband_max_scale` (default `2.0`× — i.e. up to double the base deadband at peak rate)
- `adaptive_deadband_rate_threshold` (default `0.5` °C/min — rate at which max scale is reached)

When enabled, `_get_adaptive_deadband()` derives the effective deadband from the house-wide absolute rate-of-change (averaged across rooms). It is plugged into the HVAC mode-determination deadband ([optimizer.py:743](../custom_components/smart_aircon_manager/optimizer.py#L743)), the hysteresis override threshold ([optimizer.py:888](../custom_components/smart_aircon_manager/optimizer.py#L888)), and the rooms-stable check ([optimizer.py:2853](../custom_components/smart_aircon_manager/optimizer.py#L2853)). Enhanced compressor protection margins now stack on top of the adaptive base instead of resetting to the static base.

### Medium Severity Fixes
- **Dry mode never auto-engaged on humidity-only demand**: with `auto_control_main_ac=True` and `enable_humidity_control=True`, `_check_if_ac_needed` only considered temperature, so the AC stayed off whenever temp was in deadband — even if humidity was high enough that `_determine_optimal_hvac_mode` resolved to "dry". `_async_optimize_impl` ([optimizer.py:1444](../custom_components/smart_aircon_manager/optimizer.py#L1444)) now coerces `needs_ac = True` when the resolved optimal mode is "dry" and humidity control is enabled, so the AC powers on for dehumidification.
- **Overnight schedules with day-specific days didn't activate after midnight**: a `Mon 22:00 → 06:00` schedule with `schedule_days=["monday"]` failed to match at 03:00 Tuesday because day-matching used today's calendar day. `_get_active_schedule` ([optimizer.py:537](../custom_components/smart_aircon_manager/optimizer.py#L537)) now resolves the schedule's *anchor day* (today for the evening leg, yesterday for the morning leg) and matches `schedule_days` against the anchor day, so the morning hours of an overnight schedule activate correctly.

### Low Severity Fix
- **Quick-action sleep setback not restored after HA restart**: `_load_compressor_state` restored `_quick_action_mode` and `_quick_action_expiry` but `self.target_temperature` was reloaded from config (the original, pre-sleep value), so the ±1°C sleep setback silently vanished across restarts. The load path now re-applies the in-memory effects of the active quick-action (sleep's target shift, vacation's wider deadband) using the persisted `resolved_mode` to pick the correct direction.

### Tests
- Added `TestAdaptiveDeadband` (6 cases): off-state, zero-rate, max-clamp, mid-rate linearity, no-history safety, and negative-rate magnitude handling.
- Added `TestDryModeAutoEngage` (1 case): humid+in-deadband must power on AC in dry mode.
- Added `TestOvernightScheduleDays` (3 cases): morning leg uses yesterday's anchor, evening leg uses today, wrong day stays inactive.
- Added `TestQuickActionRestartRestoration` (1 case): sleep mode's +1°C cool-mode setback is re-applied after restart.
- Suite is now 114 tests, all passing.

## v2.15.2 - Heat/Cool Symmetry Audit Fixes

**Release Date**: 2026-05-16

Follow-up review after the v2.15.1 heat-mode setpoint fix, walking the optimizer end-to-end looking for other places where heat-mode logic diverged from cool-mode in subtle ways.

### High Severity Fix
- **Heat-mode adaptive balancing convergence had inverted sign**: In `_apply_room_balancing` ([optimizer.py:2071](../custom_components/smart_aircon_manager/optimizer.py#L2071)), cool mode used `(profile.relative_heat_gain_rate - 1.0) * deviation_from_avg * 50` while heat mode used `(1.0 - profile.relative_cool_rate) * deviation_from_avg * 50` — opposite sign convention. The heat-mode balancing bias is also flipped for the active direction at [line 2100](../custom_components/smart_aircon_manager/optimizer.py#L2100), so the wrong-sign formula combined with the flip cancelled and inverted the effect: a fast-cooling (poorly-insulated) cold room ended up with LESS heating fan than other rooms, the opposite of equalization. Latent because it only triggered with `enable_adaptive_balancing=True` AND enough learning data for `should_apply_learning()` to return True. Now mirrors the cool-mode sign convention.

### Medium Severity Fix
- **Pre-positioning was direction-agnostic**: When the AC is off and dampers are pre-positioned for an upcoming startup, the code used `abs(temp - effective_target)` ([optimizer.py:1552](../custom_components/smart_aircon_manager/optimizer.py#L1552)) so a cold room in cool mode (or hot room in heat mode) got the same airflow boost as a room that actually needed the upcoming conditioning. The moment AC turned on, the wrong-direction room got over-conditioned for a cycle until regular optimization clamped it back. Pre-positioning now resolves the operating mode and only boosts rooms that need the active direction; the wrong side stays at `min_pos`.

### Low Severity Fix
- **Predictive damping ignored per-room target overrides**: `_predict_temperature` ([optimizer.py:1201](../custom_components/smart_aircon_manager/optimizer.py#L1201)) damped its rate-of-change projection using `self.target_temperature` (the global target) regardless of per-room target overrides. A room with a 22°C override sitting at 22°C looked like a 2°C gap from the global 24°C target and got under-damped, biasing the predictive fan adjustment. `_apply_predictive_adjustment` now threads the room's effective target through, with the global as fallback.

### Reviewed and Clean
Heat/cool symmetry was verified across AC on/off hysteresis, fan-speed proportional curves and overshoot tiers, predictive fan adjustment, vacant-room setback, weather adjustment, HVAC mode determination/hysteresis, sleep-mode setback, adaptive AC setpoint with efficiency, and efficiency fan-speed adjustment.

### Tests
- Added `TestAdaptiveBalancingConvergence` (2 cases): cool mode keeps working as a baseline; heat mode regression guard verifies fast-cooling cold rooms get MORE fan than hot rooms.
- Added `TestPrePositioningMode` (2 cases): cool mode prefers hot rooms; heat mode prefers cold rooms; wrong-direction rooms get `min_pos`.
- Added `TestPredictTemperatureRoomTarget` (1 case): per-room target produces smaller predicted change when the room is at its override target than the global-target fallback would suggest.
- Suite is now 103 tests, all passing.

## v2.15.1 - Heat-Mode Setpoint Overshoot Fix

**Release Date**: 2026-05-16

### High Severity Fix
- **Heating runaway to target+4°C**: In heat mode, `_calculate_ac_temperature` used `abs(temp_diff) * 2.0` for the proportional setpoint offset ([optimizer.py:2140](../custom_components/smart_aircon_manager/optimizer.py#L2140)). Because `temp_diff = avg_temp - target`, the `abs()` caused the setpoint to climb *above* target whenever the house overshot — exactly when the AC unit's internal thermostat should be coasting toward target, not chasing a higher one. With target=21°C and avg=23°C, the integration was sending the AC a 25°C setpoint, so the unit's own return-air sensor kept driving heat until rooms read ~25–26°C. Now mirrors the cool-mode formula (`max(0.0, -temp_diff * 2.0)`): offset only applies when below target, and setpoint clamps to target during overshoot.

### Tests
- Added `test_heat_mode_no_setpoint_boost_during_overshoot` (regression guard: target=21°C with one cold outlier holding AC on, avg=22°C → setpoint must not exceed 21°C). The existing heat-mode test only covered heating *up to* target, so this case slipped through.
- Added `test_heat_mode_aggressive_heat_offset` to pin the legitimate +4°C overdrive when far below target. Suite is now 98 tests, all passing.

## v2.15.0 - Heating Mode & Code Review Fixes

**Release Date**: 2026-05-09

Fixed 8 issues found during a follow-up code review, with a focus on heating-mode behavior in winter.

### Critical Fix
- **Pre-positioning crashed every cycle**: `_get_house_effective_target()` was called without its required `room_states` argument in the AC-off pre-positioning branch ([optimizer.py:1522](../custom_components/smart_aircon_manager/optimizer.py#L1522)). The `TypeError` was swallowed by the broad exception handler in `async_optimize`, so the v2.14.0 smart pre-positioning feature silently never ran. Now passes `room_states` correctly.

### High Severity Fixes
- **Dry mode no longer fires in heat mode**: When humidity control is enabled, the optimizer would switch the AC to `dry` mode whenever indoor humidity exceeded the threshold — including while heating. On most split units, dry mode runs the compressor in a low-flow refrigeration cycle that actively cools the air, fighting the heat loop. In heat mode (and auto-resolved-to-heat), dry mode is now suppressed; the system mixes only between `heat` and `fan_only` for circulation. Cool/auto-cool behavior is unchanged.
- **Adaptive AC setpoint inverted in heat mode**: When `enable_adaptive_ac_setpoint=True`, high learned efficiency added `+1.0°C` to the base setpoint. In cool mode this means a warmer setpoint = less aggressive (correct). In heat mode the base setpoint is *above* target, so `+1.0` made it MORE aggressive — the opposite of intent. The adaptive branch now short-circuits in heat mode (the underlying metric only models cooling response).
- **Adaptive efficiency fan adjustment skipped in heat mode**: `_apply_efficiency_adjustment` used `cooling_efficiency` for both modes. In heat mode this is meaningless at best and inverted at worst (a poorly-insulated room cools fast, getting flagged as "efficient" and having its heating fan reduced). Now skipped in heat mode.

### Medium Severity Fixes
- **Sleep mode no-op in auto mode**: `_enter_quick_action_mode("sleep")` checked `self.hvac_mode == "cool"/"heat"` directly, so users in auto mode got no temperature setback. Now resolves via `_get_effective_operating_mode()`. Entry-time resolved mode is also stored so exit-time restoration works correctly even if the user toggles modes during sleep.
- **Main fan recommendation sensor used hardcoded thresholds**: `MainFanSpeedRecommendationSensor.native_value` had `3.0` and `1.0` literals while the actual main-fan logic in the optimizer reads `main_fan_high_threshold` from config. The debug sensor now reads the same value, eliminating UI/behavior drift for non-default thresholds.

### Documentation
- **README version history outdated**: README claimed `v2.8.2 (Current)` while manifest was at `2.14.0`. Refreshed through v2.14.0 with one-line summaries for each release.
- **README HVAC mode list**: Notes the heat-mode dry-suppression behavior so users running humidity control in winter aren't surprised.

### Tests
- Added `TestHeatModeDryModeSuppression` (5 cases): heat + high humidity → `fan_only`; heat + humidity excess (below dry threshold) → `fan_only`; cool + high humidity still → `dry` (regression guard); auto with last-mode=heat → `fan_only`; heat + temp out-of-band → `heat` (priority preserved). Suite is now 96 tests, all passing.

## v2.13.0 - Full Bug & Logic Review (29 fixes)

**Release Date**: 2026-03-01

Fixed 29 issues (1 critical + 1 high + 15 medium + 12 low) found during comprehensive bug and logic review.

### Critical Fix
- **Config flow crash on critical room validation**: `_get_critical_room_schema()` method didn't exist — entering `temp_safe >= temp_max` crashed the config flow with `AttributeError`

### High Severity Fix
- **Weather entity temperature not normalized for Fahrenheit**: Weather entity fallback used raw temperature without F→C conversion, causing wildly wrong weather adjustments for Fahrenheit users

### Optimizer Fixes (5 medium)
- **Main fan "low for stable conditions" was dead code**: Low-speed setting for stable rooms was always overwritten by mode-specific logic; now short-circuits correctly
- **Auto mode AC turn-on ignored outlier rooms**: Unlike cool/heat modes, auto mode only checked average temp, missing individual rooms far from target
- **Auto mode AC decisions used stale mode**: `_check_if_ac_needed` was called before `_determine_optimal_hvac_mode`, using previous cycle's mode direction
- **Occupancy setback ignored by AC/stability decisions**: `_get_house_effective_target` and `_check_rooms_stable` now include occupancy-adjusted targets
- **Fan speed calculation ignored humidity mode switches**: Now uses effective operating mode instead of raw configured mode

### Config Flow Fixes (4 medium)
- **Edit room saved unstripped name**: Room names with spaces caused override key mismatches
- **No duplicate schedule name validation**: Duplicate names caused mass deletion when deleting by name
- **No schedule time ordering validation**: Users could create schedules with start_time >= end_time
- **No cross-validation of advanced thresholds**: Overshoot tiers and fan thresholds now validated for correct ordering

### Sensor Fixes (5 medium)
- **TypeError when cover_position is None**: `RoomFanRecommendationSensor` now guards both values
- **"maintaining" status when all sensors unavailable**: Now correctly returns "no_data"
- **AttributeError on first optimization cycle**: `HouseAverageHumiditySensor` attributes now use `hasattr` guard
- **TOTAL_INCREASING wrong for capped data points**: `RoomDataPointsSensor` changed to MEASUREMENT
- **TOTAL_INCREASING counter inflated on restart**: `TotalOptimizationsRunSensor` changed to MEASUREMENT

### Other Fixes (1 medium + 12 low)
- **Unload ordering**: Platforms now unloaded before optimizer cleanup to prevent teardown errors
- **disable_learning service**: Now operates on all entries when `config_entry_id` omitted
- **Manual override state**: Now persisted across HA restarts
- **Convergence rate metric**: Now measures actual convergence toward target, not direction-agnostic change
- **Fan recommendation sensor**: Uses average of all room targets instead of first room only
- **Hardcoded unit strings**: Replaced with HA constants (`SensorDeviceClass.TEMPERATURE`, `UnitOfTemperature.CELSIUS`)
- **Domain error overwrites**: Validation now preserves more specific temperature/position errors
- **Entity selector defaults**: No longer passes `None` as default for optional entity selectors
- **Critical room fields**: Changed from `vol.Optional` to `vol.Required` for safety-critical thresholds
- **Coupled rooms log**: Fixed `coupled_rooms` (list) vs `coupling_factors` (dict) mismatch
- **Humidity log**: Fixed falsy check that logged 0% instead of actual value for humidity

## v2.8.2 - Full Code Review Bug Fixes

**Release Date**: 2026-02-08

Fixed 10 bugs discovered during comprehensive code review across 4 files.

### Critical Fixes
- **Config params not passed to optimizer**: 11 config values for adaptive bands, efficiency, predictive, AC setpoint, adaptive balancing, room coupling, enhanced compressor protection, and margins were silently ignored after being saved in the UI
- **Room cache cleanup broken**: `_cleanup_room_caches` used wrong dictionary key, so stale cache entries were never cleaned (memory leak)
- **Learning data lost on restart**: Adaptive balancing fields (balancing_bias, relative_heat_gain_rate, relative_cool_rate, coupled_rooms, coupling_factors) lost every HA restart

### Logic Fixes
- **Pearson correlation formula**: Covariance used population divisor while stdev used sample divisor, producing incorrect room coupling values
- **HVAC mode sensor side effects**: Reading the sensor caused optimizer state mutation (hysteresis, compressor counters, mode flags). Now reads cached value
- **Cleanup log message**: Always showed 0 deleted rooms because it counted from already-cleaned dicts

### Other Fixes
- **room_configs wrong default type**: Default was dict instead of list
- **Quick action services not unregistered**: 4 services persisted after integration removal
- **Duplicated sensor name**: "Main Fan Speed Fan Speed Recommendation" corrected

## v2.8.0 - Stability & Bug Fix Release

**Release Date**: 2026-02-08

Major stability release addressing 15 logic issues.

### Critical Fixes
1. Quick action mode restoration logic (no longer overwrites manual changes)

### Optimizations
11. Exponential decay temperature prediction (more accurate than linear)
12. Proportional efficiency adjustment (scaled by distance from optimum)
13. Outlier filtering in convergence rate (2-sigma filter)
14. Cover state check before position commands (prevents oscillation)
15. Quick action expiry lock (prevents race condition)
